This project contains a lot of object oriented patterns I remembered from
my studies at UWO. This project contains over two thousand lines of code.
It took me the majority of a summer to complete this project. 
Mind you, I did not write specifications, I just thought it up as I went along,
and we all know that can stretch a project out. 

I originally wanted to experiment with distributed systems by making each 
animal its own process, but since new animals are created in runtime, new 
processes have to start and stop, and this caused too much overhead. So I 
decided I would go with the usual approach of handling many objects, which is 
to iterate through a list of objects within a single thread. But no worries,
there's lots of beautiful inheritance, there's a singleton class, and there's
a little multi-threading.

I should have thrown some abstract classes/interfaces in there... oh well.
